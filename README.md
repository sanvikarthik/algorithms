## Overview

This repository is a collection of essential algorithms implemented in multiple languages, useful for solving complex problems in areas like graph theory, dynamic programming, and sorting. Each algorithm is placed in its own directory, containing code and supporting documentation if necessary.

## List of Algorithms

### Graph Algorithms
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Another approach to find the Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle**: Determines whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph.
- **Warshall’s Algorithm**: Computes the transitive closure of a graph.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Dynamic Knapsack Problem**: Solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
- **Floyd’s Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Greedy Knapsack**: Solves the knapsack problem using a greedy approach.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer sorting method, faster in practice.
- **Selection Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting technique.

### Miscellaneous
- **Subset Sum**: Determines if there is a subset of numbers that sum up to a given value.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Solves the TSP problem, a classic optimization problem.
